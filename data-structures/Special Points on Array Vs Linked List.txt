Special Points on Array Vs Linked List

Array
1.Contiguous in memory
2.very limit book keeping required, only need to know the start of the array and its size
3. When inserting a new elements its is required to shifts the other elements and make a space to add the new one
4.Arrays store elements in contiguous memory locations, which makes accessing elements by index efficient. Traversing an array typically involves iterating over each element sequentially.

Linked List
1.Need an additional space for the pointers
2. when inserting a new element just need to create a new node and adjust the pointers accordingly. 
3.Linked lists store elements as nodes with references to the next (and sometimes previous) nodes. Traversing a linked list involves starting from the head node and moving to subsequent nodes until the end of the list is reached.
